       <h2 id="1">HTML</h2>
         <p>Hypertext Markup Language (HTML) is the standard markup language for creating web pages and web applications. With Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and JavaScript, it forms a triad of cornerstone technologies for the World Wide Web.
           Web browsers receive HTML documents from a web server or from local storage and render the documents into multimedia web pages. HTML describes the structure of a web page semantically and originally included cues for the appearance of the document.
           HTML elements are the building blocks of HTML pages. With HTML constructs, images and other objects such as interactive forms may be embedded into the rendered page. HTML provides a means to create structured documents by denoting structural semantics for text such as headings, paragraphs, lists, links, quotes and other items. HTML elements are delineated by tags, written using angle brackets. 
           Tags such as img and input directly introduce content into the page. </p> 
      
       <h2 id="2">CSS</h2>
         <p>What is CSS?

           CSS stands for Cascading Style Sheets
           CSS describes how HTML elements are to be displayed on screen, paper, or in other media
           CSS saves a lot of work. It can control the layout of multiple web pages all at once
           External stylesheets are stored in CSS files

          Why Use CSS?

             CSS is used to define styles for your web pages, including the design, layout and variations in display for different devices and screen sizes.

      <h2 id="4">DeptMeeting</h2>
        <p>Easy and ready communication within the department is an important sign of department health. Are people comfortable coming to you for help with individual issues?  Are people comfortable talking together about issues common to the department?  Are you able to have disagreements but still come to an acceptable resolution on difficult issues?  Yes answers are what we hope for, but they don't always come naturally. Do what you can to build a culture that encourages communication within the department.
